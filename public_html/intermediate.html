            <h1>Intermediate Method</h1>

        </div>

        <p>The intermediate method isn't really a set method of doing the cube 
            - it's more of a stepping stone on the way to learning the full
            advanced method.</p>
        <p>In this method, the last layer is done differently. The beginner
            method for the last layer is easier to learn as there are fewer 
            algorithms, but it is slow. If you want to start cutting down your
            time, then you need to start learning the advanced method, CFOP .
            However,there are a lot of algorithms to learn for the full CFOP method, 
            so this intermediate method is about how to split up some of the 
            stages so you need to learn fewer algorithms. This is actually 
            called 2-look OLL and 2-look PLL, if you want to get technical 
            about it.</p>
        <p>This method starts in exactly the same way as the beginner method 
            - cross, corners, and second layer. Then you go on to:</p>

        <h2>Step 1 - 2-look OLL</h2>
        <p>This step aims to complete the last face, regardless of the
            position of the cubies, like this:</p>
        <img class="cube" src="img/cubes/yyyyyyyyyxxxbbbbbbxxxrrrrrr.png" 
             width="200" height="200">
        <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, we're going to do this in two steps 
            (hence the '2-look').</p>
        <p>The first part of this step is to get a cross on the top face.
            At this point, however, we can be a little clever if we find 
            ourselves presented with this:</p>


        <img class="cube" src="img/cubes/xxxxyxxxxxxxbbbbbbxxxrrrrrr.png" width="200" height="200">
        <span>(R U2) (R2' F R F') U2 (R' F R F')</span>

        <p>Instead of the beginner method of using both F U R U' R' F' and
            F R U R' U' F' and having to spin the cube about in the middle,
            this algorithm flips all the edges in one go and saves us a little
            time and effort. There are loads of algorithms to do this, but I 
            like this one best. Alternatively, you could just stick to the 
            beginner way, but this algorithm will come back when you learn 
            proper OLL and you'll feel all smug when you already know it.</p>
        <p>You may have noticed some suspicious looking brackets lurking about
            in the middle of that algorithm. They are there to help you perform 
            the algorithm by splitting it up into different sections. This makes
            it both easier to read and easier to do, as the sections are usually
            only three or four moves long. You are, of course, free to ignore them
            and perform the algorithm in any way you wish.
        <p>The second part of this step is to correctly orient the corner
            cubie, so that all of the cubies have their yellow faces pointing upwards.</p>
        <p>Much like the beginner method, the rest of the last layer isn't an
            intuitive thing you can just work out (if you can, go work for NASA or something).
            Unfortunately, this means you have to just learn which algorithms correspond
            to which case. Fortunately, there are only seven of them and they're all in 
            this handy-dandy table:</p>

        <h2>Step 2 - 2-look PLL</h2>
        <p>This step aims to orient the corners in their correct positions, like this:</p>
        <img class="cube" src="img/cubes/yyyyyyyyybxbbbbbbbrxrrrrrrr.png" width="200" height="200">

        <p>Continuing the 2-look theme, we're going to do this in two steps.
            First, the corners. To do this, you need to find two corners that
            have the same colour facing away from each other, like this:</p>
        <img src="img/intermediate/corners.png" width="72" height="82">
        <p>where the indicated sides of the corners are the same colour. 
            There should only be one of these pairs on the cube, so look 
            carefully until you find it.</p>

        <p>Occasionally, however, <b>all</b> of the opposite sides will be 
            the same colour. In this case, it does not matter which way you 
            hold the cube when performing the algorithm. When doing the algorithm, 
            you hold the cube so the opposite colours are in the same place as
            indicated in the above picture.</p>
        <p>The algorithm is:</p>
        <p>x R2 D2 R U R' D2 R U' R</p>
        <p>Remember that x means to rotate the cube away from you, like doing
            R but with the whole cube. If all of the opposite sides were the
            same colour before, you will have to repeat this process, as now
            there is only one opposite pair.</p>
        <p>Now, the corners.</p>
        <p>This step aims to orientate the edges of the cross, resulting in a complete cube like so:</p>
        <img class="cube" src="img/cubes/yyyyyyyyybbbbbbbbbrrrrrrrrr.png" width="200" height="200">

        <p>You will either have one or no correct edges to being with.
            If you have one, hold the correct one away from you, but if 
            you have none it does not matter which way you hold it. There 
            are two algorithms to use, and they are very similar:</p>

        <img src="img/intermediate/edges1.png" width="72" height="72">
        <span>F2 U L R' F2 L' R U F2</span>

        <img src="img/intermediate/edges2.png" width="72" height="72">
        <span>F2 U' L R' F2 L' R U' F2</span>

        <p>Once this algorithm has been done, you have completed the Rubik's Cube!
            If you had no correct edges earlier, you will have to do the algorithm again
            , holding the now correct edge away from you. Then you will have completed 
            the Rubik's Cube!</p>
        <p>Congratulations!</p>
