        <h1>Basic Notation</h1>
        
        In order to talk about how to solve the cube, we need to have a way to easily 
        describe what moves to do.  The notation here is pretty standard, and just about
        any cube website you see that talks about moves will always use this same notation.  
        You can see all of these moves demonstrated at the bottom of the page.

        <h2>Faces</h2>
        
        There are 6 faces:  right (<strong>R</strong>), left (<strong>L</strong>), 
        up (<strong>U</strong>), down (<strong>D</strong>), front (<strong>F</strong>),
        and back (<strong>B</strong>).  Exactly which colors are on each face will depend 
        on how you hold the cube, but it's usually most convenient to talk about these 
        relative moves instead of the face colors.  Each face can be rotated in two 
        different directions.  <b>Clockwise</b>
        or <b>counter-clockwise</b> means that direction as seen when you're looking 
        straight at that face.  Another way to figure it out is to use a right hand rule.
        Point your right thumb out away from the face in question, and curl your fingers. 
        The direction of their curl is always counter-clockwise.

        <h3>Fundamental Moves</h3>
        
        The most fundamental moves are 90-degree clockwise turns of the face 
        described by the letters above.  I will also always bold moves here so 
        that they stand out from normal text.  To be completely clear, the 6 
        fundamental moves are the following:<br>
        <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>R</strong> means turn the right face such that the side on top moves to the back.</li>
                <li><strong>L</strong> means turn the left face such that the side on top moves to the front.</li>
                <li><strong>U</strong> means turn the up face such that the side in front moves to the left.</li>
                <li><strong>D</strong> means turn the down face such that the side in front moves to the right.</li>
                <li><strong>F</strong> means turn the front face such that the side on top moves to the right.</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong> means turn the back face such that the side on top moves to the left.</li>
            </ul></div>
        
        <h4>Modifiers</h4>
        Modifiers can be attached to the end of these moves to change how they turn. 
        The examples below all use <strong>R</strong> as the base move, but they 
        can be used with any face.
        <div class="list"><ul>
            <li><strong>R'</strong> (spoken "R prime") means to turn the right face 
                90-degrees counter-clockwise, i.e. in the opposite direction as above.</li>
            <li><strong>R2</strong> (spoken "R two") means to turn the right face 180-degrees.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <h5>Two-Layer Moves</h5>
        Lower case letters (<strong>r</strong>, <strong>l</strong>, <strong>u</strong>,
        <strong>d</strong>,<strong>f</strong>, and <strong>b</strong>) mean to rotate
        both the corresponding face and the central layer next to it.  For example, 4
        <strong>r</strong> means to rotate both 
        the R face and the slice between R and L together in the same direction as a normal
        <strong>R</strong> move.  The <strong> ' </strong> and <strong>2</strong> modifiers
        can be applied to these as well.
        Note that although <strong>r</strong> and <strong>L</strong> produce the same change in the cube, 
        they are not quite the same.  The difference is that they leave the cube oriented differently in 
        your hands.   <strong>L</strong> keeps the same center color on the F face, for example, but
        <strong>r</strong> moves that color to the U face.  Thus <strong>r</strong> is really equivalent
        not to <strong>L</strong>, but to <strong>Lx</strong>, where <strong>x</strong> means...

        <h6>Rotations</h6>
        These moves mean to rotate the entire cube in your hands without turning any faces. 
        The <strong> ' </strong> and <strong>2</strong> modifiers can be applied to these 
        and reverse the direction of the rotation or double it, respectively.
        <div class="list">
            <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: circle"><strong>x</strong> means to rotate the entire cube about the axis that connects R and L, 
                rotating 90-degrees clockwise in the direction of an <strong>R</strong> move.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: circle"><strong>y</strong> means to rotate the entire cube about the axis that connects U and D, 
                rotating 90-degrees clockwise in the direction of a <strong>U</strong> move.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: circle"><strong>z</strong> means to rotate the entire cube about the axis that connects F and B, 
                rotating 90-degrees clockwise in the direction of an <strong>F</strong> move.</li>
