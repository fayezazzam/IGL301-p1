        <div><h1>Beginner Method</h1>
        </div>
        <p>This website will teach you three ways of solving the Rubik's
            Cube that I call beginner, intermediate, and advanced.
            I advise you to start with the beginner method, as this will 
            take you to completely solving the cube unaided even if you've 
            never picked one up before. 
            The further two methods assume you can already solve a cube, 
            so these are aimed at those who want to start their speedcubing 
            journey of whittling their times ever downwards.</p>

        <p>Let's begin!</p>
        <h2 id="step1">Step 1 - The Cross</h2>
        <p>The first thing to know about the cube is that it is usually solved 
            layer by layer. Trying to do it face by face is practically impossible,
            as you can't complete the later faces without screwing up the ones you
            may have already done. The second thing to know is that the middle pieces 
            don't move. Go ahead, try and move them. They rotate, but they never move 
            in relation to each other, which means that each face will always be that face.
            A common mistake people make when they first approach an unsolved cube is to think 
            they have to solve 54 stickers. In fact, there are only 20 pieces that actually move
            around - 8 corner pieces and 12 edge pieces.</p>

        <p>The first thing you have to do is to create a cross on the first layer, like so:</p>

        <img class="cube" src="1.png" width="200" height="200">

        <p>Grey 'cubies' (the smaller cubes that make up the Rubik's Cube)
            are cubies that are not important at this stage, and you can just ignore
            them.</p>

        <p>You will notice that this cross is white, a decision not made at random.
            Throughout this website, it will always be assumed that the first 
            face is the white face. Every single time you do the cube, you should
            start with the white face so you get used to always looking out for the
            same colours at different stages. If I were to pick up a cube and start
            with, say, the green face, I would get terribly confused when it came to 
            the last layer because I am so used to looking for yellow pieces instead 
            of blue ones. Most other Rubik's Cube resources also start with the white
            face, so if you get used to it now you'll always know precisely what's going on.</p>

        <p>Explaining exactly how to create this cross can be a little challenging, 
            as it relies mostly on logic. Later in this guide, I will be able to tell
            you exactly which moves to perform in sequences called <b>algorithms</b> but
            because you are starting from a scrambled cube, this step will be different 
            every time. I heartily recommend that you see if you can just work out how to
            assemble this cross, if not as a mental exercise then as a bit of fun.
            If you are struggling, or don't think this qualifies as fun, or perhaps 
            if you're only here to learn to solve a Rubik's Cube as soon as possible 
            in order to win a bet and aren't interested in whimsical things like fun,
            then there are some scenarios you can watch out for:</p>
